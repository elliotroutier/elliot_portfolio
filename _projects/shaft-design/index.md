title: Shaft Design - Forklift Transmission for Vehicle
description:  This shaft design project formed the first part of my Design Materials and Manufacturing module ‚Äî an 8-week team challenge to develop a power transmission sub-assembly for a custom electric forklift operating in a stone quarry near Bath. I was responsible for load analysis, material selection, and technical documentation.
skills: 
  - CAD
  - Material Selection
  - Fatigue and Failure Analysis
  - Iteration
  - Torque Analysis
  - Keyway Design
  - Bearing Selection
  - Stress Concentration Handling

## Objectives
The project was grounded in real world engineering constraints, including the need to lift 1-tonne stone blocks, achieve long service life (10 years, 12 hours/day), and meet tight cost and sustainability targets. Working as part of a team, we developed and iterated a complete shaft design including chain drives, bearings, keyways, and circlips. My analysis involved detailed loading calculations, bending moment and torque diagrams, stress analysis, and component 
selection. I performed material selection using merit indices, Ashby charts and assessed manufacturing costs.

## Final thoughts
This project strengthened my ability to balance analytical design with practical manufacturing constraints. It deepened my appreciation for real-world complexity in seemingly ‚Äúsimple‚Äù components like shafts ‚Äî a lesson I‚Äôll carry into industry placements and beyond.
