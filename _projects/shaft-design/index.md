## 🛠️ Project Overview

This 8-week project tasked us with designing a power transmission shaft sub-assembly for a forklift operating in demanding quarry conditions. The shaft needed to meet strict performance, cost, and sustainability requirements — making it a highly realistic engineering challenge.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Lift and position 1-tonne stone blocks  
- Ensure 10+ years of life (12 hours/day)  
- Meet cost and sustainability targets  
- Model and analyse torque, stress, and fatigue  
- Include chain drives, keyways, bearings, and circlips

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This project deepened my understanding of shaft mechanics, stress concentration, and mechanical integrity. It pushed me to balance **analytical precision with practical manufacturability** and gave me a better appreciation of how each component fits into a real-world system. It also highlighted the importance of time management and cross-functional collaboration in a fast-paced design process.
