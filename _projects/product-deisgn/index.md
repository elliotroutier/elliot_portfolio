# Objectives
To select a real-world user scenario and developed a product to address the gap in 
the market to assist elderly/handicapped individuals entering and exiting their vehicles.

## Key Deliverables
Deliverables were under the form of 4 posters:
- POSTER 1: User research & PDS-formatted requirements list   
- POSTER 2: Concept generation, evaluation, and hand-drawn sketches   
- POSTER 3: Final CAD design, exploded views, and function explanation 
- POSTER 4: Material selection, manufacturing plan, and Eco-audit-based environmental

## Final thoughts
This project challenged me to consider safety, manufacturability, system logic, and cost in a 
realistic, multi-disciplinary design setting while challenging my CAD skills and time 
management skills as the project was very short. It was a strong exercise in collaborative
system engineering, combining creativity with structured problem-solving to deliver a technically
viable solution.
