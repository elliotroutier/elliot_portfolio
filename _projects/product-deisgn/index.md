description:  This project was part of the Design, Materials, and Manufacturing module. It involved creating a mechanical product to support older users with mobility challenges, no electronics or digital systems allowed.
skills: 
  - CAD
  - Materials & Manufacturing Process Selection
  - Fatigue and Failure Analysis
  - Iteration
  - Prototyping
  - Sketching

# Objectives
To select a real-world user scenario and developed a product to address the gap in 
the market to assist elderly/handicapped individuals entering and exiting their vehicles.

## Key Deliverables
Deliverables were under the form of 4 posters:
- POSTER 1: User research & PDS-formatted requirements list   
- POSTER 2: Concept generation, evaluation, and hand-drawn sketches   
- POSTER 3: Final CAD design, exploded views, and function explanation 
- POSTER 4: Material selection, manufacturing plan, and Eco-audit-based environmental

## Final thoughts
I contributed to mechanical design work, CAD modelling, and creating visual 
materials for the posters. I also supported the requirements definition and final concept 
evaluation. This project strengthened my ability to deliver clear, user-focused engineering solutions 
under real-world design constraints.
