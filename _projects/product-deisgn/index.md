## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project involved developing a practical, user-focused product to assist older adults with limited mobility — specifically with entering and exiting vehicles. The brief required a **purely mechanical solution**, challenging us to blend thoughtful ergonomics with realistic manufacturing and sustainability constraints.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Select a real-world user group  
- Identify a mobility-related challenge  
- Develop a solution with no electronics or software  
- Ensure the design is feasible, manufacturable, and environmentally conscious

## 🧩 What I Delivered

This was a poster-based project, submitted through four structured A1 panels:

✅ **Poster 1** – User research and a structured PDS (Product Design Specification)  
✅ **Poster 2** – Concept generation, evaluation, and hand-drawn sketches  
✅ **Poster 3** – Final CAD model with exploded views and functional breakdown  
✅ **Poster 4** – Material selection, manufacturing plan, and environmental audit

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This project taught me how to translate user needs into practical, manufacturable design under real constraints. I contributed across the entire workflow — from early research and CAD modelling to sustainability considerations and presentation. It sharpened my design judgment and pushed me to think critically about accessibility and real-world application.
