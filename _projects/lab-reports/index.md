title: Lab Reports - Experimental Analysis and Technical Reports 
description:  This section contains two of my most comprehensive lab reports from the University of Bathâ€™s Mechanical Engineering programme. Both reports are part of the thermofluids module â€“ a combination between thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. 
skills: 
  - Technical writing
  - Data interpretation
  - Error analysis
  - Scientific referencing

## Objectives
The goal of these lab reports was to develop my ability to plan and communicate experimental investigations in a clear and technical format. Each report required accurate data analysis, interpretation of results, and discussion of experimental limitations. I aimed to strengthen my scientific writing, apply theoretical principles to practical setups, and present findings in a structured, reader-friendly way suitable for academic and professional audiences.

## My Contributions

1. Led the redesign of the battery pack reducing the pack weight from 6 to 1kg

2. Integrated sensor systems and a new microcontroller for real-time performance tracking

3. Soldered and fitted the microcontroller onto the vehicle

4. Tuned a PID controller for the car's speed control

## Final thoughts
Working with Green Bath Racing gave me hands-on experience in sustainable engineering and real-world vehicle design. I developed a stronger understanding of low-voltage power systems, data-driven decision-making, and cross-functional collaboration â€” all under the pressure of an international competition setting.
