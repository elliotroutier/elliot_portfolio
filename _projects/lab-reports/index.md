## ðŸ§  Objectives

These reports strengthened my ability to design, execute, and interpret experimental tests using core thermodynamics and fluid mechanics principles. I focused on accurate data analysis, error handling, and clear scientific communication.

## ðŸ§ª Steam Motor Lab

Explored the difference between real and ideal Rankine cycles using a TD 1050 steam motor. Analysed system performance using the Willans line, specific steam consumption, and Sankey diagrams. Calculated the dryness fraction via a throttling calorimeter.

## ðŸŒ€ Aerofoil Lab

Tested pressure distribution and lift coefficients across different angles of attack for a NACA 2415 aerofoil. Demonstrated the impact of Reynolds number and slat deployment on stall characteristics and lift enhancement.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts

These labs helped bridge the gap between theory and application. From building experimental setups to interpreting real data, I developed the confidence to solve practical engineering problems using analytical thinking and effective communication.
