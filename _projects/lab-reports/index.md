title: Lab Reports - Experimental Analysis and Technical Reports 
description:  This section contains two of my most comprehensive lab reports from the University of Bathâ€™s Mechanical Engineering programme. Both reports are part of the thermofluids module â€“ a combination between thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. 
skills: 
  - Technical writing
  - Data interpretation
  - Error analysis
  - Scientific referencing

## Objectives
The goal of these lab reports was to develop my ability to plan and communicate experimental investigations in a clear and technical format. Each report required accurate data analysis, interpretation of results, and discussion of experimental limitations. I aimed to strengthen my scientific writing, apply theoretical principles to practical setups, and present findings in a structured, reader-friendly way suitable for academic and professional audiences.

## Steam Motor Lab Report
Compared the real and ideal Rankine cycles using a TD 1050 steam motor. Analysed mechanical losses using the Willans line and evaluated system efficiency through specific steam consumption and a Sankey diagram. Calculated the dryness fraction using a throttling calorimeter.

## Aerofoil Lab Report
Investigated how pressure distribution and lift coefficient vary with angle of attack for a NACA 2415 aerofoil, both with and without a leading-edge slat. The experiment demonstrated the impact of Reynolds number and slat deployment on delaying stall and increasing lift.

## Final thoughts
These two lab experiments deepened my understanding of core mechanical engineering principles â€” from fluid dynamics and aerofoil behaviour to thermodynamic cycles and energy efficiency. They challenged me to apply theory in a practical setting, interpret real-world data, and communicate technical insights effectively. The skills developed through these experiences continue to shape my approach to engineering analysis and problem-solving.
