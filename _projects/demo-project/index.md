## 🛠️ Project Overview

As part of the Design, Materials, and Manufacturing module, I worked in a team to develop a concept for a fully automated machine that assembles battery modules for an electric hovercraft. The challenge: design a system that could handle every step — from sorting cells to spot-welding connections — under a strict time and budget constraint.

## 🎯 Objectives

The machine had to perform the following tasks:
1. Unpack cylindrical battery cells  
2. Sort them by polarity  
3. Place them into carriers  
4. Spot-weld copper strips for electrical connectivity  
5. Eject completed modules  
6. Complete a full cycle in under 200 seconds  
7. Stay within a budget of £20,000

## 📦 My Contributions & Deliverables

Throughout the project, I contributed to the design and evaluation of the system by producing:

- ✅ **3D CAD models** of the full assembly and critical sub-systems  
- ✅ **UML activity diagrams** to visualise system logic and task sequencing  
- ✅ **Manufacturing operations plan** outlining each production stage  
- ✅ **DFMEA and fault tree analysis** to identify risks and failure modes  
- ✅ **Storyboard and physical layout** showing process flow and ergonomics

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This project tested my ability to balance creativity with feasibility in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary team. From selecting components to evaluating system logic and risk, I gained hands-on experience in applying **design-for-manufacture (DFM)** principles, safety assessments, and **collaborative problem-solving**. The tight timeframe pushed my CAD and time management skills — and gave me a real taste of system-level mechanical design in a professional setting.
