# Objectives
The objectives for this was project were to 
1. Unpack cylindrical battery cells
2. Sort them based on polarity
3. Place them into carriers
4. Spot-weld copper strips as electrical connections
5. Eject the completed modules
6. Complete one cycle in under 200 seconds
7. Limited budget of Â£20,000
8. The full brief is outlined below:

## Key Deliverables
Some of the key deliverables included
- CAD models of the full and sub-assemblies
- A UML activity diagram to represent system logic
- A manufacturing operations plan
- An FMECA and fault tree analysis
- A physical layout and storyboard to visualise process flow

## Final thoughts
This project challenged me to consider safety, manufacturability, system logic, and cost in a 
realistic, multi-disciplinary design setting while challenging my CAD skills and time 
management skills as the project was very short. It was a strong exercise in collaborative
system engineering, combining creativity with structured problem-solving to deliver a technically
viable solution.
