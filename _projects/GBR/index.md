## Objectives
As a Powertrain Engineer for Green Bath Racing, my role focused on designing and optimising components for an ultra-efficient electric vehicle competing in the Shell Eco-marathon. The objective was to minimise energy consumption while maintaining performance and reliability. This involved careful motor selection, sensor integration, and contributing to the vehicleâ€™s telemetry system to monitor performance in real time.

## My Contributions

1. Led the redesign of the battery pack reducing the pack weight from 6 to 1kg

2. Integrated sensor systems and a new microcontroller for real-time performance tracking

3. Soldered and fitted the microcontroller onto the vehicle

4. Tuned a PID controller for the car's speed control

## Final thoughts
Working with Green Bath Racing gave me hands-on experience in sustainable engineering and real-world vehicle design. I developed a stronger understanding of low-voltage power systems, data-driven decision-making, and cross-functional collaboration â€” all under the pressure of an international competition setting.
