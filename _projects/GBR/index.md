## 🛠️ Project Overview

As a Powertrain Engineer for Green Bath Racing, I helped design and optimise systems for an ultra-efficient electric vehicle competing in the Shell Eco-marathon. The primary challenge was to minimise energy consumption while maintaining mechanical performance and electrical reliability.

## 🏁 Shell Eco-marathon 2025 – Silesia Ring, Poland
The highlight of the year was travelling with Green Bath Racing to the Shell Eco-marathon 2025, held at the Silesia Ring in Poland. Competing against top engineering teams from across Europe, we were proud to finish 4th overall, a testament to the months of design, testing, and teamwork.

The atmosphere at the track was electric — from scrutineering and strategy planning to the final laps. This experience not only tested our technical ability but also bonded the team through long days, late nights, and a shared passion for sustainable innovation.
