title: Python Chess Game - Object Oriented Programming
description: To prepare for my university Python module, I developed a fully functional chess game using Python and object-oriented programming principles.  
skills: 
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Game Logic
  - Debugging
  - Testing
  - User Interface Design

## Motivation
This project began as a personal challenge to deepen my understanding of Python through a structured and engaging task: building a fully functional chess game from scratch. Motivated by my interest in game design and algorithmic thinking, I set out to recreate the rules and mechanics of chess without relying on external game engines. The aim was to design a turn-based system that accurately enforced legal moves, captured game states, and handled special rules like castling and en passant. Along the way, I also developed a simple user interface, allowing players to interact with the game via the console.

## Note
The game isn't perfectde to the T and does not handle check states or en castling very well - aside from which the game works very well.

## Note
1. Open the link to dropbox
2. Download the zip file
3. Unpack the folders within
4. Open VS code or jupyter or spyder...
5. Execute and run the main.py file
6. Ensure you have pygame installed
7. Have fun!

## Final Thoughts

Building this chess game from the ground up was both challenging and rewarding. It pushed me to think critically about game logic, data structures, and user experience while strengthening my confidence in Python. By breaking down complex mechanics into manageable components, I gained valuable problem-solving skills and a deeper appreciation for how games function behind the scenes. This project reinforced my ability to work independently and take a concept from idea to execution.
