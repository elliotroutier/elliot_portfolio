## 🛠️ Project Overview

This self-initiated project challenged me to write a full chess engine from scratch using Python. I focused on object-oriented programming principles to manage piece behaviour, turn-based logic, and special rules like castling, promotion, and en passant.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

I built this project to deepen my understanding of Python before starting university coursework. It provided a structured, creative challenge and let me explore how real-time game logic and state tracking work in code.

## 🧩 Download and Run the Code

📥 **[Download Chess Game Files (ZIP)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pf5g12n2b5hllcjk9f2vw/CHESS.zip?rlkey=moib05y5lkxb0y3o900tlckel&st=z542yp8q&dl=1){:target="_blank"}**

📌 To run the game:
1. Unzip the folder locally  
2. Open in VS Code, Jupyter, or Spyder  
3. Run `main.py`  
4. Ensure `pygame` is installed  
5. Enjoy the game!

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This project helped me turn abstract programming concepts into something interactive and real. It gave me practical problem-solving skills and experience with game logic, user input handling, and modular code structure — all of which I carry into my other projects.
