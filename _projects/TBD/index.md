## Objectives
As a Mechanical Design Engineer for Team Bath Drones, my role centred on developing structural and functional components for our UAV, designed to compete in the IMechE UAS Challenge. The objective was to create a lightweight, modular, and reliable drone capable of autonomous payload delivery. My work involved CAD modelling of key subsystems such as chassis reinforcements and trap door mechanisms, ensuring structural integrity while enabling mission-specific functionality. I also contributed to team design reviews and iterative prototyping to refine system performance under competition constraints.

## Final thoughts
Working with Team Bath Drones gave me hands-on experience in UAV design under real competition constraints. I developed practical skills in CAD, mechanical integration, and collaborative engineering, while contributing to a project that demanded precision, innovation, and cross-functional teamwork. This experience strengthened my confidence in applying engineering principles to fast-paced, real-world challenges.
